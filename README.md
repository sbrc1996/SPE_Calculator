# SPE_Calculator..

This repository is used to implement a calculator like app using Java 11. Here we show the usecase of how to build a sample project in Java and then Use a VCS like Git & GitHub. Moreover develop a CI pipeline using Jenkins and GitSCM polling to design the continous pipelines for seamless development and testing. Also we use JUnit for writing the unit test cases and Maven for building the entire project. We use Docker for the containerization purpose and Ansible for Configuration Management. We also use the ELK stack here.
